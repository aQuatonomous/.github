## ⚙️ How We Operate

To keep our projects organized and collaborative, we use a clear repository naming convention and structured contribution process.

### 📛 Repository Naming

- All repos use **descriptive kebab-case** names. 🐧
- Each repo should include a README following this [template](https://www.makeareadme.com/). 📄
- README credits must include: your full name, subteam, academic program, and year. 🎓✍️
  
**Example repository names:**

- `a-star-path-planner` ⭐
- `3d-buoy-map-generator` 🗺️

### 🔐 Access & Collaboration

- The GitHub organization is managed under the `aquatonomous-dev` account. 🛠️
- Captains and core leads have direct access to this account for deployments and permissions. 🧑‍✈️👩‍✈️
- To contribute, you **must be added as a collaborator** on the appropriate repository by a captain or lead. 🤝  
- Please **do not push changes directly from the `aquatonomous-dev` account** to ensure proper version control and review. 🚫🧑‍💻

### 👋 Joining the Team

If you are new:

- Join our [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/aquatonomous-group/shared_invite/zt-2lcn2ih1v-eImu1XUcyaWQmjU3MI0OnA) and Microsoft Teams channels. 💬
- Share your GitHub username in your subteam’s Slack channel (Electrical, Perception, Autonomy). 🧑‍💻⚡👀🤖
- Select a project and notify your subteam. 🗂️
- Complete the accessibility form if applicable. 📝
