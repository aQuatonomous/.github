Welcome to the ***aQuatonomous*** GitHub repository! 

***aQuatonomous*** is a new interdisciplinary design team at Queen's University aiming to build an X-class autonomous surface vessel (ASV) with the intention of participating in RoboNation's RoboBoat competition in February 2025.

To maintain organization and clarity within our project, we have implemented a standardized naming scheme for our repositories. This document will guide you through the process of naming and categorizing your repositories appropriately.

## Joining the Team

If you haven't already, please make sure to:

-   Join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/aquatonomous-group/shared_invite/zt-2lcn2ih1v-eImu1XUcyaWQmjU3MI0OnA) and Teams channels.
-   Send your GitHub username to your subteam chat if you plan on contributing to the software (Electrical, Perception, Autonomy).
-   Pick a project and notify your subteam in Slack.
-   Fill out the accessibility form if needed.

## Naming Scheme
All repositories should follow this format:
`<subteam>_<dev or prod>_<project name>_<active or deprecated>`
     
### Subteam
Choose the appropriate subteam for your repository:
- `mechanical` for the Mechanical team
- `electrical` for the Electrical team
- `perception` for the Perception team
- `autonomy` for the Autonomy team
### Development Stage

Indicate the development stage of the project:
- `dev` for development
- `prod` for production

### Project Name

Provide a concise and descriptive name for the project. This should reflect the primary focus or function of the project.

### Status

Specify the current status of the project:
- `active` for ongoing projects
- `deprecated` for projects that are no longer maintained

### Examples

- `mechanical_dev_hullDesign_active`
- `electrical_prod_sensorSuite_deprecated`
- `autonomy_dev_pathPlanning_active`


## Competitions and Testing
Our dynamic field tests will be held at Lake Ontario, with additional testing at on-campus water locations such as the ARC pool and the coastal research lab. We are also preparing for the RoboNation's RoboBoat Competition in February 2025 and the Toronto Solar Boat Race. Your contributions are crucial to our success in these events.

For more details, please refer to the competition sites:
