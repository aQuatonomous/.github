Welcome to the ***aQuatonomous*** GitHub organization! 

***aQuatonomous*** is a new interdisciplinary design team at Queen's University aiming to build an X-class autonomous surface vessel (ASV) with the intention of participating in RoboNation's RoboBoat competition in February 2025.

To maintain organization and clarity within our project, we have implemented a standardized naming scheme for our repositories. This document will guide you through the process of naming and categorizing your repositories appropriately.

## Joining the Team

If you haven't already, please make sure to:

-   Join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/aquatonomous-group/shared_invite/zt-2lcn2ih1v-eImu1XUcyaWQmjU3MI0OnA) and Teams channels.
-   Send your GitHub username to your subteam chat if you plan on contributing to the software (Electrical, Perception, Autonomy).
-   Pick a project and notify your subteam in Slack.
-   Fill out the accessibility form if needed.

## Naming Scheme
All repositories should have a descriptive kebab-case name. Your README should look something like this [template](https://www.makeareadme.com/). Make sure to credit yourself, including your name, sub-team, program and the year!

### Naming Examples
- a-star-path-planner
- 3d-buoy-map-generator

## Competitions and Testing
Our dynamic field tests will be held at Lake Ontario, with additional testing at on-campus water locations such as the ARC pool and the coastal research lab. We are also preparing for the RoboNation's RoboBoat Competition in February 2025 and the Toronto Solar Boat Race. Your contributions are crucial to our success in these events.

For more details, please refer to the competition sites:
